# Minecraft
Steps:

      :)First u have to install python 
          *For windows: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
          *For linux: Command => 
               Open up your terminal 
                      sudo apt-get update
                      sudo apt-get install python
                      sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
                      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
                      sudo apt-get update
                      sudo apt-get install python3
                      sudo apt-get update
                      sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev wget
               Make a new directory to store the Python source files:
                      mkdir /python && cd /python
                      wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.1/Python-3.9.1.tgz
               Extract the TGZ file that you just downloaded:
                       tar â€“xf Python-3.9.1.tgz
               u can do manualy by going into that file location and extracting if the above command does not work properly        
                       cd python-3.9.1
                       sudo make install
                       sudo apt-get install python
                       sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install python
                
      :)Second Installing ursiengine by visiting website https://www.ursinaengine.org/ 
            *For window from the above link u can install easily by using command prompt or by powershell
            *For Linux following commands =>
                          python --version
                      Make a directory for ursiengine
                          mkdir code
                          cd code
                      Make a python venv
                          python3 -m venv ursinaTut
                      Activate ursina
                          source ursinaTut/bin/activate
                          pip install git+https://github.com/pokepetter/ursina.git
                          
      :)Third go to ur terminal and direct towards the file location where ursina is installed 
             Type this command =>
                      git clone https://github.com/amaygit/Minecraft.git
                      
             
      :)Fourth to run this u can use any python code editor of your choice
                I recommend u to go for visual studio code or pycharm
          
      :)Boom ur minecraft is ready to run.........:)
